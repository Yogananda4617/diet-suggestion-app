            <h3>Apples:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to wrap your head around the fact that you are helping yourself to lose weight when you eat an apple. They are so sweet that they 
                end up in a lot of dessets. But they are low in all of the things that you want them to be like calorie, fat, and sodium. They have a good amount 
                of fiber. The fiber helps you feel full and keeps you from going mad in betweeen meals. It also helps keep things moving along degestively. 
                Just be sure to chew your apple up real well before swallowing and buy organic so you can leave the peel on.</p>

                first is that it assists your body in expelling toxins and other wastes. It also helps with digestion and keeps good bacteria in your gut.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the fast food chains have jumped on this trend and are sticking guacamole in everything, eating avacados is a great idea for 
                slimming down. For years they were avoided by dieters because of their fat content. when everything that had fat in it was labeled as evil. 
                Then we got smart and realized that not all fat is created equally and good fats actually help you lose the fat you have. Try adding avocado 
                slices to sandwiches or mash them up to make your own guac. Try to avoid the guacamole you see in restautants because you won't have quality 
                control over the ingredients.

                into the day. Since they're so versatile. Cut some up and add it to oatmeal, keep a bunch around as a quick grab when you need something sweet 
                or on-the-go. Just stick to one a day since they are a source of sugar as well.

                with digestion due to their fiber content. Try adding a can of organic black beans as a side to your next meal, especially if it can replace a more 
                card-laden item like bread or rice. Many restaurants keep black beans on hand as a substitute for a side, so they're a great go-to item when you're

                be responsible for helping the body break down fats and sugars, plus they taste amazing and can flavor up otherwise tame meals. They also play 
                well with other fruits in a fruit salad. Just be sure to eat them without adding sugar to them. We singled out blueberries for their fat busting

            <h3>Olive Oil:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason olive oil helps you to lose weight is because it can take the place of other things like salad dressing and other oils that are 
                considered bad fats. Even you change nothing else in your diet or lifestyle and just start using olive oil you should still benefit of losing 
                weight. But most people find that if they start to embrace more of a Mediterranean diet the results are accentuated. Almost any diet that replaced 
                the standard American Diet is going to be better for you and cause the pounds to drop and using more olive oil in your life can bring many 
                positive benefits.

            <h3>Oranges:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy Vitamin C levels will help to keep you functioning at optimal levels, but if you're looking to burn fat you might be concerned about 
                the sugar in oranges. There's no getting around it, oranges do contain sugar, which has the potential to turn to fat if it's not burned up.
                But the calorie count is low and the fiber actually helps to regulate your blood glucose levels. In order for this to work out for you as a 
                weight loss aid, eat it in moderatian and to curb your sweet tooth when you'd otherwise be researching for a candy bar or other sweet treat.

            <h3>Organic Lean Meats:</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean meats are full of protien without all of the fat, but you want to make sure that you opt for organic if you're trying to lose weight. 
                With conventional meets they're pumping the cows, pigs and other animals full of so many antibiotics and growth hormones which ends up in the meat 
                you're eating. This can thwart your weight loss efforts. Organic meats aren't going to contain more nutrients in them than ordinary meats, but 
                it's what they don't have in them that makes the difference. If you can't find organic, go with grass fed or all-natural.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gets special mention for weight loss because it's a good fat that can be used to help lose fat. It tastes great and can satisfy carvings and 
                even keep them from coming at all. In the Abs Diet peanut butter is recommended for use in smoothies and is labeled a superfood. Almond butter is 
                also a good fat to have that can provide a lot of creamy goodness, but it's generally more expensive than peanut butter. In any instance opt for the 
                organic varieties so you're only getting peanuts and potentially sea salt.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salmon contains omega-3 and some diets are built around it. At first glance you might think it's too fatty to be weight loss super food, 
                but it doesn't rank high in saturated fat, the kind that you find in a fast food hamburger and the omega-3 content trumps any other concerns.
